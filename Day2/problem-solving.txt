inputs
string of numbers separated by spaces
desired output 
whether the string is safe

solve an example by hand
in 1 3 2 5 9
out not safe because not increasing or decreasing
in 1 5 8 9 
out not safe cause increase between 1 and 5 greater than 3
in 1 3 3 5
out not safe cause 3 3 is not increase or decrease
in 1 3 5 6 9
out safe cause increasing or decreasing, and diffs <= 3

write the steps for solving general instances of the 
problem using the steps I used to solve specific instances
of the problem

previousNum = firstNum
nextNum = secondNum
